# CS23302--DATA-STRUCTURES

Welcome to the repository for CS23302--DATA-STRUCTURES! This repository houses course contains materials, lab experiments.

## Objectives

1. Learn about different data structures and why they are useful.
2. Understand how sorting and searching algorithms work and how fast they are.
3. Be able to create and use both simple and complex data structures.
4. Choose the best way to search or sort data for a specific problem.
5. Understand the basics of algorithms and how to use them in software.

## Outcomes

Upon completion of the course, students will be able to:

1. Apply efficient data structures required for an application
2. Compare sorting algorithms on time complexity
3. Understand, design and implement linear and non-linear data structures
4. Appreciate basic and optimal search structures
5. Select suitable search algorithm for an application
